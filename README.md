## Developer Notes
1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` on the root directory.
2. `npm start` will bundle and run the bot for you.
3. Run `npm run build:watch` and `npm run dev` on different terminals to automatically re-bundle and restart the bot everytime you make a change.
3. `npm run build` will bundle the files for you. The bundled file can be found in `build/bundle.js`. The bundled file can be run by node via `node build/bundle.js`
