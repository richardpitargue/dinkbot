# dinkbot

## Developer Notes
1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` on the root directory.
2. Run `npm start` or `gulp` to run the bot and watch for changes inside the `src` directory.
3. Run `gulp build` to create the bundle without running the bot. Alternatively, `gulp start` will run the bot without watching for changes.
